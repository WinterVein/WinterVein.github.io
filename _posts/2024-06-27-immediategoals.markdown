Given the long production time of a story driven game, it is important to set immediate goals and work towards each of them. For the early stage of development that we're currently at, we are set on making and releasing a 15-20 minute demo for "Caterpillar".
Other names under consideration for this project/game are "SandTrack" and "Locust".

In addition some of the immediate goals consist of demoing cutscenes and adding other story vignettes to the end of the demo to prepare players for what's to come.
