This is the first post dedicated to sharing news about the game we're developing, codenamed SandBlast for now. Not much to be said as of now except that basic sprites, assets, and code has been written to make a working development prototype. The game will be a top-down story driven RPG with eight-directional movement set in a fictional land inspired by modern conflict of the 21st and late 20th centuries.

Details of the game will become available as development continues.

We (the devs) can be contacted with questions, feedback, and contributions over email at the following address:
